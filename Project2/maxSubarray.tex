	\section{Recursive function}
		\lstinputlisting[language=C++]{rec.cpp}

		Where {\tt maxS} is a struct holding the running sum and the overall maximum sum and {\tt MaxSubarray} is the recursive function. For an array $A$ of size $n$, we find the maximum subarray with {\tt MaxSubarray(A, n)}.


	\section{Pseudocode}
		\begin{verbatim}
		 1  MaxSubarray(array, size):
		 2      current = 0;
		 3      max = 0;
		 4      index = 0;
		 5
		 6      while index < size:
		 7          current = current + array[index-1]
		 8          if current < 0:
		 9              current = 0
		10          else if current > max:
		11              max = current
		12          index = index + 1
		13
		14      return max
		\end{verbatim}


	\section{Running time}
		% Using the Log-Log plot will give us a good hint for the asymptotic run times.
		% The slope for the graph is 0.987956, meaning that the asymptotic run times is around $\Omega(n)$.
		% Then looking at the code, it only looks at each element once, making it $\Omega(n)$

		The code shows that we look at each element of the input array only once, so the algorithm's runtime should be $\Theta(n)$.

		Figure~\ref{fig:alg4} shows the execution time of this algorithm versus the size of the input array. The slope of the graph is $0.987956$, which confirms the runtime of $\Theta(n)$.

	\section{Theoretical correctness}
		{\bf Claim}: {\tt MaxSubarray(A, n)} will return the sum of the maximum subarray of an array $A$ of size $n$.

		{\bf Proof}: As a base case, consider $n=0$. Then {\tt max} = {\tt current} $= 0$, which is correct.

		For the inductive hypothesis, assume that {\tt MaxSubarray(A, n)} will correctly return the sum of the maximum subarray of an array $A$ of size $n$. We must show that {\tt MaxSubarray(A, n+1)} will do the same for an array $A$ of size $n+1$.

		We have two cases to consider:

		{\it Case 1}: $A[n] \geq 0$. Since we are adding each element of the array to the current running sum on line 7, {\tt current} will correctly increase and be correctly captured as the maximum sum on line 11.

		{\it Case 2}: $A[n] < -${\tt MaxSubarray(A, n)}. This will drive the running sum into the negative, so {\tt current} will correctly ``reset'' to zero on line 9, effectively ignoring the sum up to element $n$. 

		On the other hand, {\tt max} retains its value, so the overall maximum sum is correctly preserved.

		\begin{center}
		$\Box$
		\end{center}

			% \textbf{Proof:}\\
			% Case if $A[n] > 0$ then $current = MS(n-1).current + A[n] > MS(n-1).current$. \\
			% \indent This number might also be the max value. So $max = Greater(max,current)$\\
			% Case if $A[n] >  - maxSubarray(n-1)$ then $maxSubarray(n-1) + A[n] < 0$ making the Null set greater.\\
			% \indent $max = MS(n-1).max$ and $current = 0$ \\
			% Case else making $A[n]$ negative but $maxSubarray(n-1) + A[n] >= 0$\\
			% \indent so it is still good to use for the next current: $current + A[n+1] > A[n+1]$\\
			% \indent $max = MS(n-1).max$ and $current = maxSubarray(n-1) + A[n]$\\
			% $MS(n).max = max$ and $MS(n).current = current$

	\section{Implement}
		\subsection{Algorithm 4}
		\lstinputlisting[language=C++]{alg4.cpp}


	\section{Test}
		Tests were run on the {\tt ms\_test.txt} file given for the last project and large arrays given by student IDs.


\begin{samepage}
	\section{Compare}
		The two algorithms, one using divide-and-conquer and the other dynamic programming, were each tested with random arrays of different sizes created using {\tt analysis.cpp} (same as previous project). The results of the tests is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:algcomp}.

		The dynamic programming algorithm ($\Theta(n)$ time) is shown to be much more efficient than the divide-and-conquer algorithm ($O(n \log n)$ time) for a randomly sorted array. Additionally, since the DP algorithm does not have any recursive calls and needs to keep track of only two numbers ({\tt current} and {\tt max}), it is much less memory-intensive compared to the D\&C algorithm.
